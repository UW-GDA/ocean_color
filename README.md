## Summary: 
Using ocean surface color data to identify the area that algae tends to grow.
I would like to look into the area on the ocean surface that has a good condition for algae to grow. Algae requires nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, trace elements, and warm temperature to thrive. By using the Landsat data, we can track chlorophyll A, an indicator for algae growth. From this project, I hope to identify the good location in the ocean that has nutrient and good temperature where we can grow kelp for carbon capture. 


## Some introductory background information: 
Algae likes to growth at the high temperature with high nitrate concentration. Therefore, we will use the data set from Argo for nitrate, NOAA for temperature and chlorophyll.

## Problem statement, question(s) and/or objective(s): 
Which variable is more important to algae growth (temperature or nutrient)? What is the limitation factor for algae growth? What is the distribution of nutrient and temperature across the ocean and how it corresponds to algae?

## Datasets you will use:
Temperature: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/NOAA_CDR_OISST_V2_1 

Ocean color: https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/JAXA_GCOM-C_L3_OCEAN_CHLA_V2?hl=en

Biological Argo: https://biogeochemical-argo.org/data-access.php

## Tools/packages youâ€™ll use (with links): 
Raster time series

## Planned methodology/approach: 
Zoom in the coast of Washington state where we can optimize the code.

## Expected outcomes: 
Generate the time series for temperature and nutrients that corresponding to the growth of algae (chlorophyll variable).

## Any other relevant information, images/tables, references, etc.
