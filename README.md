Summary: Using ocean surface color data to identify the area that algae tends to grow.
I would like to look into the area on the ocean surface that has a good condition for algae to grow. Algae requires nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, trace elements, and warm temperature to thrive. By using the Landsat data, we can track chlorophyll A, an indicator for algae growth. From this project, I hope to identify the good location in the ocean that has nutrient and good temperature where we can grow kelp for carbon capture.
